# Final-Project
Our final project lets you track the meals you eat by letting you input the information about said meals. You can view the meals you've eaten for the day, as well as the total calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates you've eaten that day. You can also view the meals you've eaten on other days, as well as view the total of only one macronutrient value. In addition, you can see all of the meals you've tracked on here.

Working features/things you should test:
java MealTracker

java MealTracker total

java MealTracker (date) total

java MealTracker total (date) (fats/calories/carbs/protein)

How to use:

Usage: Compile MealTracker.java, then run java MealTracker.

For advanced users: java MealTracker [date][total] : displays totals for that date.

java MealTracker [date][total][calories] OR [protein] OR [carbs] OR [fats]: displays total macronutrient of your choice for that date.
